The File attached is an Excel file about NY Citi Bikes and analyzing data to improve the company
Some of the questions answered during the projects are;
1. What are the most popular pick-up locations across the city for NY Citi Bike rental?
2. How does the average trip duration vary across different age groups?
3. Which age group rents the most bikes?
4. How does bike rental vary across the two user groups (one-time users vs long-term subscribers) on different days of the week?
5. Does user age impact the average bike trip duration?
